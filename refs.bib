	abstract = {Path planning for sailboat robots is a challenging task particularly due to the kinematics and dynamics modelling of such kinds of wind propelled boats. The problem is divided into two layers. The first one is global were a general trajectory composed of waypoints is planned, which can be done automatically based on some variables such as weather conditions or defined by hand using some human–robot interface (a ground-station). In the second local layer, at execution time, the global route should be followed by making the sailboat proceed between each pair of consecutive waypoints. Our proposal in this paper is an algorithm for the global, path generation layer, which has been developed for the N-Boat (The Sailboat Robot project), in order to compute feasible sailing routes between a start and a target point while avoiding dangerous situations such as obstacles and borders. A reinforcement learning approach (Q-Learning) is used based on a reward matrix and a set of actions that changes according to wind directions to account for the dead zone, which is the region against the wind where the sailboat can not gain velocity. Our algorithm generates straight and zigzag paths accounting for wind direction. The path generated also guarantees the sailboat safety and robustness, enabling it to sail for long periods of time, depending only on the start and target points defined for this global planning. The result is the development of a complete path planner algorithm that, together with the local planner solved in previous work, can be used to allow the final developments of an N-Boat making it a fully autonomous sailboat.},

	abstract = {Maritime autonomous transportation has played a crucial role in the globalization of the world economy. Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}) has been applied to automatic path planning to simulate vessel collision avoidance situations in open seas. End-to-end approaches that learn complex mappings directly from the input have poor generalization to reach the targets in different environments. In this work, we present a new strategy called state-action rotation to improve agent’s performance in unseen situations by rotating the obtained experience (state-action-state) and preserving them in the replay buffer. We designed our model based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, local view maker, and planner. Our agent uses two deep Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the policy and action-value functions. The proposed model was exhaustively trained and tested in maritime scenarios with real maps from cities such as Montreal and Halifax. Experimental results show that the state-action rotation on top of the {CVN} consistently improves the rate of arrival to a destination ({RATD}) by up 11.96\% with respect to the Vessel Navigator with Planner and Local View ({VNPLV}), as well as it achieves superior performance in unseen mappings by up 30.82\%. Our proposed approach exhibits advantages in terms of robustness when tested in a new environment, supporting the idea that generalization can be achieved by using state-action rotation.},

A model of the dynamics of the sailboat is described together with a suitable choice of actions, in the form of a Markov decision process ({MDP}), which allows the application of a wide variety of {DRL} algorithms.

	abstract = {In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.
Gradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.},

The development of a real-time path following and collision avoidance system complying with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea ({COLREGs}) is crucial to the development of autonomous ships. In this study, we proposed a novel deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) algorithm to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the path following and collision avoidance system. To verify the proposed algorithm, we conducted simulations of an autonomous ship under unknown environmental disturbances to adjust its heading in real time. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the autonomous ship was developed, and a line-of-sight ({LOS}) guidance system was used to guide the autonomous ship along a predefined path. Then, a proximal policy optimization ({PPO}) algorithm was implemented for the problem. We found that, after applying the advanced deep-{RL} method, an autonomous ship could learn the safest and most economical avoidance behavior through repeated trials. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm guaranteed collision avoidance with encountered moving ships while ensuring that the ship followed a predefined path. Additionally, the algorithm demonstrated that it could manage complex scenarios with various encountered ships in compliance with {COLREGs}, showing excellent adaptability to unknown complex environments.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a tool able to support the sailing yacht designer during the early stage of the design process has been developed. Cubic Rational Bézier curves have been selected to describe the main curves deﬁning the hull of a sailing yacht. The adopted approach is based upon the deﬁnition of a set of parameters, say the length of waterline, the beam of the waterline, canoe body draft and some dimensionless coefﬁcients according to the traditional way of the yacht designer. Some geometrical constraints imposed on the curves (e.g., continuity, endpoint angles, curvature) have been conceived aimed to avoid unreasonable shapes. These curves can be imported into any commercial Computer Aided Design ({CAD}) software and used as a frame to ﬁt with a surface. The resistance of the hull can be calculated and plotted in order to have a real time estimation of the performances. The algorithm and the related Graphical User Interface ({GUI}) have been written in Visual Basic for Excel. To test the usability and the precision of the tool, two existing sailboats with different characteristics have been successfully replicated and a new design, taking advantages of both the hulls, has been developed. The new design shows good performances in terms of resistance values in a wide range of Froude numbers with respect to the original hulls.},

Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now {SRI} International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.
Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, the A* algorithm only finds the shortest path from a specified source to a specified goal, and not the shortest-path tree from a specified source to all possible goals. This is a necessary trade-off for using a specific-goal-directed heuristic. For Dijkstra's algorithm, since the entire shortest-path tree is generated, every node is a goal, and there can be no specific-goal-directed heuristic.},

A lot of research is concentrated on finding the shortest (in geometrical sense) paths while in many applications finding smooth paths (rather than the shortest ones but containing sharp turns) is preferable. In this paper we study the problem of generating smooth paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning. We put angle-constrained path planning problem formally and present a new algorithm tailored to solve it – {LIAN}. We examine {LIAN} both theoretically and empirically. We show that it is sound and complete (under some restrictions). We also show that {LIAN} outperforms the analogues when solving numerous path planning tasks within urban outdoor navigation scenarios.},

	abstract = {This is a mechanical system for wingsail control. The windthrust to the boat is controlled automatically at all times with the only control for the pilot is a simple lever Forward, Neutral and Reverse no further adjusting system - no ropes no sheets no winches everything is automatic except the control to go stop or reverse. The system gives exactly the same power in reverse setting.
You can stop the boat instantly and reverse out of difficult situations if necessary.

	abstract = {A two-stage ship path planning method is proposed, based on the Rapid-exploring Random Tree ({RRT}) algorithm, which is composed of global path planning and local path planning, addressing the important problem of finding an economical and safe path from start to destination for ships under dynamic environment, especially in waters with multiple obstacles and multiple target ships. The global path planning takes into consideration the ship draft and Under Keel Clearance to find navigable water using {RRT}, and reduces the path length and waypoints based on elliptic sampling and smoothing. In the local path planning, a dynamic collision risk detection model is constructed by introducing the Quaternion Ship Domain under a dynamic environment, and the restrictions of ship manoeuvrability and {COLREGs} are also involved. The simulation results show that the proposed model can find a satisfactory path within a few iterations, and keep clear of both static obstacles and dynamic ships. The research can be used to make and verify planned ship routes before sailing and to guide officers to make decisions regarding collision avoidance.},

	abstract = {Unter einem Schwert versteht man im Schiffbau und in der Seefahrt eine oder zwei auf Schwertbooten parallel zur Fahrtrichtung senkrechte Platten aus Stahl, Holz oder GFK zur Verminderung der Abdrift bzw. zur Umsetzung der Abdrift in Vortrieb.
Neben dem Haupttypus, den Zentralschwertern, unterscheidet man zwischen den Seitenschwertern (bei Ewern und anderen Flachbodenschiffen paarweise seitlich außenbords angebracht) und Kimmschwertern (zwei Seitenschwerter innerhalb des Bootsrumpfes); Kielschwerter sollen die Vorzüge des aufholbaren Schwertes und des Ballastkiels miteinander verbinden.
Der Tiefgang des Schwertes kann in der Regel stufenlos verstellt werden. Das erleichtert das Manövrieren bei geringer Wassertiefe und ermöglicht höhere Geschwindigkeiten durch ein Heraufholen des Schwertes bei Vorwindkurs und vorwindnahen Raumschotskursen, da so der Wasserwiderstand verringert wird. Ein verstellbares Schwert wird von einem umgebenden Schwertkasten gehalten.
Ein Schwert vermindert die seitliche Abdrift vor allem durch die größere Fläche im Lateralplan, bei höheren Geschwindigkeiten aber auch durch den dynamischen Auftrieb der anliegenden laminaren Strömung. Mangels Masse schützt ein Schwert, im Gegensatz zu Flossenkielen oder Ballastschwertern, nicht gegen Kentern. Es dämpft aber durch den seitlichen Wasserwiderstand die Rollbewegungen und stabilisiert so das Boot.},

	abstract = {Der dynamische Auftrieb ist in der Strömungsmechanik der Anteil der auf einen umströmten Körper wirkenden Kraft, der senkrecht zur Anströmrichtung steht. Der dynamische Auftrieb ist das physikalische Grundprinzip für das natürliche Fliegen von Vögeln und Fledertieren. Außerdem ist er die Grundlage für die Funktion der Tragflächen von Flugzeugen, der Propeller, der Schiffsschrauben, der Segel, der Turbinen und Auftriebsläufer-Windkraftanlagen. Effekte des dynamischen Auftriebs werden auch zur Steuerung von U-Booten und Luftschiffen genutzt.
Die Entstehung von Auftrieb durch Anströmung wird mit der Methodik der Fluiddynamik erklärt. Diese ist Teil der klassischen Mechanik und wird mit den Newtonschen Gesetzen und den hieraus abgeleiteten Erhaltungssätzen (Impuls-, Drehimpuls- und Energieerhaltung) beschrieben. Bei kompressiblem Medium (Gas) ist außerdem eine thermodynamische Betrachtung der Vorgänge erforderlich.
Auftrieb entsteht bei Umströmung entsprechend geformter Körper, z. B. Tragflächen, indem Luft bei ihrer Passage nach unten beschleunigt wird, was sich in Abb. 1 als Strömungsumlenkung nach unten niederschlägt. Der abwärts gerichteten Kraft auf die Luft entspricht als Gegenkraft die aufwärts gerichtete Kraft auf die Tragfläche, der Auftrieb. Auftriebskräfte können auch in Richtung Erdboden wirken und werden dann als Abtrieb bezeichnet. Bei Rennfahrzeugen kann so mit Hilfe von Front- und Heckflügeln Anpressdruck erzeugt werden.},

Aus der Form des Lateralplans lassen sich Abschätzungen zur Drehfreudigkeit (Manövrierbarkeit) des Schiffs ableiten. Je nachdem, ob der Kiel lang, kurz oder tief ist, spricht man von einem langen, kurzen, tiefen oder auch flachen Lateralplan. Ein großer und langgestreckter Lateralplan bewirkt eine gute Kursstabilität, verringert jedoch mit entsprechend großem Reibungswiderstand die Geschwindigkeit. Ein kleiner und kurzer Lateralplan (zum Teil auch: geteilter oder „beschnittener“ Lateralplan) hat einen geringeren Widerstand, die Yacht neigt jedoch eher dazu, „aus dem Ruder zu laufen“, das heißt zu ungewünschten Richtungsänderungen.
Der geometrische Schwerpunkt (Flächenschwerpunkt) des Lateralplans wird als Lateralschwerpunkt oder auch als Lateraldruckpunkt bezeichnet.},

The global path planning takes into consideration the ship draft and Under Keel Clearance to find navigable water using RRT, and reduces the path length and waypoints based on elliptic sampling and smoothing. In the local path planning, a dynamic collision risk detection model is constructed by introducing the Quaternion Ship Domain under a dynamic environment, and the restrictions of ship manoeuvrability and COLREGs are also involved. The simulation results show that the proposed model can find a satisfactory path within a few iterations, and keep clear of both static obstacles and dynamic ships. The research can be used to make and verify planned ship routes before sailing and to guide officers to make decisions regarding collision avoidance.},

A lot of research is concentrated on finding the shortest (in geometrical sense) paths while in many applications finding smooth paths (rather than the shortest ones but containing sharp turns) is preferable. In this paper we study the problem of generating smooth paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning. We put angle-constrained path planning problem formally and present a new algorithm tailored to solve it – LIAN. We examine LIAN both theoretically and empirically. We show that it is sound and complete (under some restrictions). We also show that LIAN outperforms the analogues when solving numerous path planning tasks within urban outdoor navigation scenarios.},

It can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.
Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, the A* algorithm only finds the shortest path from a specified source to a specified goal, and not the shortest-path tree from a specified source to all possible goals. This is a necessary trade-off for using a specific-goal-directed heuristic. For Dijkstra's algorithm, since the entire shortest-path tree is generated, every node is a goal, and there can be no specific-goal-directed heuristic.},

	abstract = {Path planning for sailboat robots is a challenging task particularly due to the kinematics and dynamics modelling of such kinds of wind propelled boats. The problem is divided into two layers. The first one is global were a general trajectory composed of waypoints is planned, which can be done automatically based on some variables such as weather conditions or defined by hand using some human–robot interface (a ground-station). In the second local layer, at execution time, the global route should be followed by making the sailboat proceed between each pair of consecutive waypoints. Our proposal in this paper is an algorithm for the global, path generation layer, which has been developed for the N-Boat (The Sailboat Robot project), in order to compute feasible sailing routes between a start and a target point while avoiding dangerous situations such as obstacles and borders. A reinforcement learning approach (Q-Learning) is used based on a reward matrix and a set of actions that changes according to wind directions to account for the dead zone, which is the region against the wind where the sailboat can not gain velocity. Our algorithm generates straight and zigzag paths accounting for wind direction. The path generated also guarantees the sailboat safety and robustness, enabling it to sail for long periods of time, depending only on the start and target points defined for this global planning. The result is the development of a complete path planner algorithm that, together with the local planner solved in previous work, can be used to allow the final developments of an N-Boat making it a fully autonomous sailboat.},

	abstract = {Path planning for sailboat robots is a challenging task particularly due to the kinematics and dynamics modelling of such kinds of wind propelled boats. The problem is divided into two layers. The first one is global where a general trajectory composed of waypoints is planned, which can be done automatically based on some variables such as weather conditions or defined by hand using some human–robot interface (a ground-station). In the second local layer, at execution time, the global route should be followed by making the sailboat proceed between each pair of consecutive waypoints. Our proposal in this paper is an algorithm for the global, path generation layer, which has been developed for the N-Boat (The Sailboat Robot project), in order to compute feasible sailing routes between a start and a target point while avoiding dangerous situations such as obstacles and borders. A reinforcement learning approach (Q-Learning) is used based on a reward matrix and a set of actions that changes according to wind directions to account for the dead zone, which is the region against the wind where the sailboat can not gain velocity. Our algorithm generates straight and zigzag paths accounting for wind direction. The path generated also guarantees the sailboat safety and robustness, enabling it to sail for long periods of time, depending only on the start and target points defined for this global planning. The result is the development of a complete path planner algorithm that, together with the local planner solved in previous work, can be used to allow the final developments of an N-Boat making it a fully autonomous sailboat.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a tool able to support the sailing yacht designer during the early stage of the design process has been developed. Cubic Rational Bézier curves have been selected to describe the main curves deﬁning the hull of a sailing yacht. The adopted approach is based upon the deﬁnition of a set of parameters, say the length of waterline, the beam of the waterline, canoe body draft and some dimensionless coefﬁcients according to the traditional way of the yacht designer. Some geometrical constraints imposed on the curves (e.g., continuity, endpoint angles, curvature) have been conceived aimed to avoid unreasonable shapes. These curves can be imported into any commercial Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and used as a frame to ﬁt with a surface. The resistance of the hull can be calculated and plotted in order to have a real time estimation of the performances. The algorithm and the related Graphical User Interface (GUI) have been written in Visual Basic for Excel. To test the usability and the precision of the tool, two existing sailboats with different characteristics have been successfully replicated and a new design, taking advantages of both the hulls, has been developed. The new design shows good performances in terms of resistance values in a wide range of Froude numbers with respect to the original hulls.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.
Gradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.},

The development of a real-time path following and collision avoidance system complying with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) is crucial to the development of autonomous ships. In this study, we proposed a novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the path following and collision avoidance system. To verify the proposed algorithm, we conducted simulations of an autonomous ship under unknown environmental disturbances to adjust its heading in real time. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the autonomous ship was developed, and a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance system was used to guide the autonomous ship along a predefined path. Then, a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm was implemented for the problem. We found that, after applying the advanced deep-RL method, an autonomous ship could learn the safest and most economical avoidance behavior through repeated trials. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm guaranteed collision avoidance with encountered moving ships while ensuring that the ship followed a predefined path. Additionally, the algorithm demonstrated that it could manage complex scenarios with various encountered ships in compliance with COLREGs, showing excellent adaptability to unknown complex environments.},

	abstract = {Maritime autonomous transportation has played a crucial role in the globalization of the world economy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to automatic path planning to simulate vessel collision avoidance situations in open seas. End-to-end approaches that learn complex mappings directly from the input have poor generalization to reach the targets in different environments. In this work, we present a new strategy called state-action rotation to improve agent’s performance in unseen situations by rotating the obtained experience (state-action-state) and preserving them in the replay buffer. We designed our model based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, local view maker, and planner. Our agent uses two deep Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the policy and action-value functions. The proposed model was exhaustively trained and tested in maritime scenarios with real maps from cities such as Montreal and Halifax. Experimental results show that the state-action rotation on top of the CVN consistently improves the rate of arrival to a destination (RATD) by up 11.96\% with respect to the Vessel Navigator with Planner and Local View (VNPLV), as well as it achieves superior performance in unseen mappings by up 30.82\%. Our proposed approach exhibits advantages in terms of robustness when tested in a new environment, supporting the idea that generalization can be achieved by using state-action rotation.},

The goal of the research is to consider the mathematical model and the adaptive synthetic methods basing on the fuzzy logic of the control system of the ship that is negatively affected by the external disturbances to its operation. Consequently, it’s considered the problem of design and modelling of the self-tuning auto pilot regulator of the ship (Auto pilot regulator). The paper devotes the experiment on the Offshore service Vessel in Vietnam with the method as: the mathematical models of ship motion, the mathematical model of the auto pilot regulator, synthetic of the ship control algorithms based on the approached fuzzy logic method.},
